<main>
  <h1><%= current_page.data.fetch("title") %></h1>

  <p>This was generated by the <code>rails generate sitepress:install</code> command.</p>

  <h2>Content</h2>
  <p>Sitepress content files are in <code><%= site.root_path.expand_path %></code>. There you can edit site content, including this file at <code><%= current_page.asset.path %></code>.

  <h2>Routes</h2>
  <p>Sitepress defined a root route in <code><%= Rails.root.join("config/routes.rb") %></code>. If that conflicts with your routes configuration, you'll want to open it and edit accordingly.</p>

  <h2>Documentation</h2>
  <p>Check out the <a href="https://sitepress.cc">Sitepress website</a> for help on getting started and documentation. Since Sitepress is also built on top of Rails, most of the <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_view_helpers.html">Rails view helpers</a> work too.</p>
